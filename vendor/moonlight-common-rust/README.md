# moonlight-common-rust [WIP]

`moonlight-common-rust` is a Rust implementation of the Moonlight game streaming protocol built around a Sans-IO architecture.

It provides a transport-agnostic protocol core with packet parsing and state management fully decoupled from networking and async runtimes. The crate also includes bindings to Moonlight Common C for interoperability with the existing implementation.

The Sans IO implementation is not finished yet.

## Why Sans-IO?

Separating protocol logic from I/O makes the library flexible and reusable across different environments.

Because the core does not depend on native sockets or a specific runtime, it can:

- Integrate with custom networking backends
- Work with any async ecosystem
- Support multiple independent streams within a single process
- Compile to WebAssembly and run in the browser, where networking is provided externally (e.g. WebRTC, WebTransport, Direct Sockets in IWA's)

This design allows the same protocol implementation to be reused across native and web targets while remaining modular and easy to embed.

## Usage

The [`examples/`](./examples) directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the crate with the I/O implementations this library provides.

If you directly want to use the Sans IO protocol implementation, take a look at the [proto module](src/stream/proto/mod.rs) and the [std](src/stream/std/mod.rs) or [tokio](TODO) stream implementations as an example on how to use it.
